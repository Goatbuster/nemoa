Nemoa
========

*Nemoa* is a python package for creating and analysing deep neuronal networks from gene expression data.
For a current featurelist see the [changelog](https://github.com/fishroot/metapath/blob/master/changelog.md).

#### Contributing ####
The long-term goal is to split the project:

* A *central data mining und data analysis library* based on deep artificial neuronal networks,
which allows any data mining / data collecting application to: train an artificial neuronal network
to reconstruct missing information, reduce the dimensionality of the data, reduce noise,
classify data or to perform explorative data analysis.
This library should be fast and clean. Parallel computing is obviously necessary.

* Userfriendly interfaces for various applications: bioConductor
*interface for analysing and visualising gene expression data, nextgen sequencing data*

If you share this vision and want to collaborate you are very welcome!
