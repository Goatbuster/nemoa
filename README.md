MetaPath
========

*MetaPath* is a python package for creating and analysing deep neuronal networks from gene expression data.
For a current featurelist see the [changelog](https://github.com/fishroot/metapath/blob/master/changelog.md).

#### Collaboration ####
The long-term goal is to split the project:

* A *central data mining und data analysis interface* based on deep artificial neuronal networks,
which allows any data collecting application to reconstruct missing information,
reduce the dimensionality of the data, classify and analyse the data. Parallel computing is obviously necessary.

* An userfriendly *interface for analysing and visualising Gene Expression Data, NextGen Sequencing Data* etc.
For example as a bioConductor package.

If you share this vision and want to collaborate you are very welcome!
