Nemoa
========

*Nemoa* is a python package for training and analysing deep neural networks. The intention of the project is to develope a *central data mining und data analysis system* based on artificial neural networks, which allows any data mining and data collecting application to train and stack modules of artificial neural networks to handle missing or corrupted information, reduce the dimensionality of data for further analysis, classify data and perform explorative data analysis by exploiting the structure of the trained modules. The requirements therefore include efficient implementations of existing algorithm and intuitive software interfaces to other application. Centralized and parallel computing is obviously necessary. For a current featurelist see the [changelog](https://github.com/fishroot/metapath/blob/master/changelog.md).

#### Contributing ####
The long-term goal of the project is to improve and also spread nemoa by creating userfriendly applications. For example *automatic intelligent systems for human disease recognition* using a central anonymized gene expression database, which continously trains and analyses large instances of ann based modules using nemoa. This could heavily improve and speed up medical diagnostics and for example yield much more precise predictions than biomarkers! So why not reaching for the stars when its technical possible?!
