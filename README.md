Nemoa
========

*Nemoa* is a python package for creating and analysing deep neuronal networks.
For a current featurelist see the [changelog](https://github.com/fishroot/metapath/blob/master/changelog.md).

The goal is to create a *central data mining und data analysis library* based on artificial neural networks,
which allows any data mining / data collecting application to: Train and stack modules of artificial neuronal networks to handle missing / corrupted information in data, Reduce noise in the data, Reduce the dimensionality of the data for further analysis, Classify data - or to perform explorative data analysis by exploiting the structure of the trained modules. This library should be fast and clean and provide intuitive interfaces to other application. Centralized computing and parallel computing is obviously necessary.

#### Contributing ####
The long-term goal (or maybe with enough contributors the not so long-term) is to improve *nemoa* and to create userfriendly interfaces for various applications: For example a *automatic intelligent system for human disease recognition* using a central anonymized database, which continously trains and analyses large instances of ann based modules using *nemoa*. (why not reaching for the stars when its technical possible?!)
