* test

#### 0.4.40noGPU-20130626 ####
This is the first documented version containing following implementations:
* ANN modeling: autoencoders (Pretraining with RBMs, GRBMs)
* ANN based trannsformations: dimensionality reducing transformation with autoencoders
* ANN based analysis: data manipulation tests on various node and node interaction properties of deep networks, correlation analysis
* Data interface: Currently only .csv files
* Data preprocessing: annotation (with bioConductor wrapper), linear stratification from different datasources, normalization (z-trans, mean-trans), data filtering with bicorrelation cluster analysis
* Visualisation: Heatmaps of ANN, RBM, GRBM manipulation results, Histograms, Graphs (various layouts)
